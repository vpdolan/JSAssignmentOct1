Excellent exercise integrating HTML with JS coding.
This exercise taught me how important it is to be accurate naming the HTML elements the same as those in the main.js coding. Though I had difficulty coding exercises #4-#6, after repeated attempts to ensure my coding for these exercises was correct, I felt comfortable with my js coding.  It was not an issue to have the first four exercises print to the viewed page. However, I had difficulty with getting the answers to exercises five and six to print due to a console error which stated appendChild was null.  After reviewing the coding several times, and googling several sources to understand the definition of the meaning of appendChild as null, I learned the cause of my problem: a simple naming error was the cause (ex: id class="#Answer5" was written in HTML; appendChild(#answer5) was written in main.js file). Once the id class was changed to lowercase and thus matched the js coding, all six answers were observed on the page.
